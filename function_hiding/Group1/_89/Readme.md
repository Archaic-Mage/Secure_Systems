Input format : there are 3 inputs that were supposed to be given.

Give first number : <Give an integer here>
Give second number : <Give another intger here>

Give password for hidden function / sum function : <Password>

There are three possibilities :

1) You give the correct password for sum function, the sum of the first and second number will be printed.

2) You give the correct password for the hidden function, then the correct value gets after the hidden function computation.

3) The password given was neither sum function nor the hidden function. In this case an access issue statement will be printed.

Password for sum function is : ab34ef78

There exists a password for the hidden function as well, just like sum function.

Correct computational output can be given only if the correct password is given.

Otherwise a access issue error will be given.
